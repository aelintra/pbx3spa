# Reference: current system (SARK)

Sample and structure from the older SARK PBX UI (Aelintra) to inform the new PBX3 admin frontend.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **sark-extensions-page-source.html** | Condensed structure of the SARK Extensions page: layout (top bar, black nav, dropdowns), nav groups (Endpoints, PBX, Settings, Net), table (columns, Edit/Del, confirm). |

See **workingdocs/UX_APPROACH.md** §9 for how we use this: what we keep (layout, grouping, table pattern) and what we do differently (SPA, API, auth).
